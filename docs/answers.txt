    inheritance: is where a class can be derived from another class so they have access to all of the features
    of a certain class. 

    polymorphism: is where a an interface can be represented by several different data types

    encapsulation: is the practice of hiding all of the values in an object of a class by keeping them all 
    private.

    this workflow is when a repository has hundreds of developers
    and the managers of the of the repo are called the lieutenants.
    the integration workflow is when a single integration manager can handle
    the source code contributions.

    dictator and lietanant workflow can benefit a repository 
    that contains a large amount of variables because with the availabilty
    of many repositories the likeliness of a single developer ruining the 
    master branch is tremendously reduced.
